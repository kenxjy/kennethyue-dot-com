# A New Journey: Developing a Comprehensive System

## Starting from scratch: Round Two

Following the success of my collaboration with [Warranty Claim Services](./02-wcs), I dove in head first into a new project with [The Symes](https://thesymes.ca), a company that had a vision of what they wanted in their customer relationship management (CRM) application. However, we were starting from square one, which made the development process challenging.

## The Development Process

As a single developer, I decided to use Firebase as our official backend after experimenting with it and receiving positive feedback from The Symes. Firebase is a backend-as-a-service that handles the setup of a Node.js server and a database, allowing me to focus primarily on developing the app itself. Using Firebase in the prototype for the new CRM was a key decision that enabled the development process to proceed efficiently.

## The Migration and Development Shift

After months of development, we were ready to migrate the new CRM from the old system. The migration process was relatively smooth and quick, given that The Symes was not an new company at the time, and the amount of data to be migrated was manageable. Although new goals were added and targets were changed, we completed module after module until we surpassed our initial vision. Our goal was to create a comprehensive CRM that could manage The Symes' operations from start to finish. Every step of the operation should be doable on this new CRM. After several more months of development, we successfully developed an all-encompassing system that can manage their operations from start to finish.

<!-- ## The Impact -->

## Conclusion

In conclusion, developing the new CRM as a solo developer was a significant challenge, but using Firebase and the subsequent development shift allowed us to surpass our initial vision and create an all-encompassing system that can manage The Symes' operations from start to finish.

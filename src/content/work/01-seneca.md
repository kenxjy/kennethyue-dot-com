# The Start of My Journey as a Software Developer

## Introduction

My journey as a Software Developer began at Seneca College. Drawing from my hobbies and previous experiences with computer programming classes, I found success in my first year. It was during courses involving C++ and various web technologies that I realized I had made the correct career choice.

## What I Learned

At Seneca, I studied Object-Oriented Programming with C++ and Java, Modern (for 2018) Web Development with Node.js, React and Angular, and Databases and SQL with IBM db2 and OracleDB, as well as NoSQL databases using MongoDB. These topics equipped me with fundamental knowledge and skills that I have honed over the years and still apply to my work. While I found the coursework to be comprehensive, I find classes about data structures and learning Big-O notation to be a bit lacking. However, I took it upon myself to learn about these topics on my own time outside of class.

## Some of My Projects

Over the course of my studies at Seneca, I completed several projects and assignments that I am particularly proud of, which can be viewed on my [Github page](https://github.com/kenxjy). These include:

- [Object Oriented Programming (OOP345) Final Assignment](https://github.com/kenxjy/OOP345-Final_Project)
- [Java Workshops (JAC444)](https://github.com/kenxjy/JAC444-workshops)
- [Web Development (WEB322) Final Assignment](https://github.com/kenxjy/WEB322-assignment6)

These projects allowed me to apply and expand upon the skills and knowledge I gained from my coursework at Seneca.
